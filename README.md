# AUTO_LOGIN

AUTO_LOGIN so after getting into my code let me give me some idea about my project what this essentially does is when you run the code what ever the link present in the driver 
you can access that particular website and you can auto login to that particular account for instance if you go put the facebook.com in driver.get() then it will direct to thefacebook
site and what you need to do is you need to give your email id and password in the compiler it will auto type it self and opens up facebook similarly for gmail etc.. for which email and passwords were valid
